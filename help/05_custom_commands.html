    <h1>Configuring Custom Commands</h1>
    <p>
    StartExplorer can be extended and customized by the user
    by custom commands. Custom commands are sent to the command
    line so your custom commands can do anything that you can
    do from the command line.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can add as many custom commands as you want. Custom 
    commands will be shown in a sub menu of StartExplorer's
    context menus.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Configuring Custom Commands</h2>
    <p>
    Go to Window - Preferences - StartExplorer - Custom Commands 
    to access StartExplorer's preference page. The upper area
    of the preference page is used to configure custom
    commands. The table shows you all configured custom
    commands. By default, there are already two custom commands
    (Notepad and UltraEdit). The buttons to the right
    of the table allow you to 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Add</b> new custom commands,</li>
      <li><b>Edit</b> existing custom commands,</li>
      <li><b>Remove</b> existing custom commands and</li>
      <li>reorder the custom commands by moving individual
      commands <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <a name="add"/>
    <h3>Add a new custom command</h3>
    <p>
    Click the <i>Add</i> button. You can configure the new custom command
    in the following dialog.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Command:</i> Enter the command to run. The command will
        be run via <code>java.lang.Runtime.exec</code>, that is,
        it will be executed as if you had entered the command on the
        command line.<br/>
        Example command: <code>notepad ${resource_path}</code><br/>
        This opens the selected file(s) in Notepad (notepad.exe needs
        to be on the system path). 
        <code>${resource_path}</code> is a <a href="#variables">variable</a>
        that will be replaced with the selected resouce's absolute path when
        the command is executed.
      </li>
      <li><i>Enabled for resources:</i> If this option is checked, the
      custom command will appear in the context menu for resource views
      (Navigator, Package Explorer, etc.). If the option is unchecked,
      the custom command will not be shown in this context menu (useful
      if you only want to use this custom command for selected text regions
      in editors).
      </li>
      <li><i>Name for resources menu:</i> The name which is shown in the
      context menu for resource views.
      </li>
      <li><i>Enabled for text selections:</i> If this option is checked,
      the custom command will appear in the context menu for selected text
      regions in editors. If the option is unchecked, the custom command
      will not be shown in this context menu (useful if you only want 
      to use this custom command in resource views).
      </li>
      <li><i>Name for text selection menu:</i>The name which shown in the
      context menu for selected text regions in editors.
      </li>
      <li><i>Resource Type:</i> You can configure the resource type a custom command is intended for,
      either "Files", "Folders" or "Files & Folders". If a custom command that
      is intended for files is execute on a directory, a dialog box with an error
      message is shown and no action is taken. If, on the other hand, a custom
      command intended for a folder is executed on a file, the command
      automatically uses the parent directory. Finally, for a custom command that
      is intended for files & folders, no such check is executed before invoking
      the command.
      </li>
      <li><i>Pass selected text to application:</i> This changes the
      behaviour for the custom command when it is executed from within
      an editor for a selected text region. By default - when this option
      is <i>not</i> checked - the selected text will be interpreted
      as a filesystem path (denoting a file or a folder) and the custom
      command will be executed for this resource. If this option is checked
      the selected text will be passed to the command. StartExplorer
      will create a temp file which contains the selected text and
      calls the custom command with that temp file. To be precise:
      All supported <a href="#variables">variables</a> will be substituted based
      on this temp file. You almost always will want to use the <code>${resource_path}</code>
      variable for this use case.
      <br/>
      Example: To pass the selected text to your favourite editor, say
      Notepad (although I doubt that this is your favourite editor),
      you could configure the command like this:
      </li>
      <ul>
	    <li><i>Command:</i> notepad ${resource_path}</li>
	    <li><i>Enabled for resources:</i> No</li>
	    <li><i>Name for resources menu:</i> leave this text field blank</li>
	    <li><i>Enabled for text selections:</i> Yes</li>
	    <li><i>Name for text selection menu:</i> Copy to Notepad</li>
	    <li><i>Pass selected text to application:</i> Yes</li>
	  </ul>
    </ul>    
    <p>
    The export button let's you export the command definition to the file
    system, see <a href="#import-export">Importing and exporting custom commands</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Edit an existing custom command</h3>
    <p>
    Select an existing custom command in the table and click the
    <i>Edit</i> button or simply double click a custom command.
    You can configure the new custom command in the following 
    dialog. The dialog is exactly the same as for
    <a href="#add">adding new custom commands</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Remove an existing custom command</h3>
    <p>
    Select an existing custom command in the table and click the
    <i>Remove</i> button to delete custom commands.
    </p>

    <h3>Reorder the custom commands</h3>
    <p>
    Select an existing custom command in the table and use the
    buttons <i>Up</i> and <i>Down</i> to change the order in 
    which the custom commands appear in the context menu.
    </p>
    
    <a name="import-export"/></a>
    <h3>Importing and exporting custom commands</h3>
    <p>
    Command definitions can be exported to the file system. The dialog to edit a custom
    command offers an Export button. Click the button and choose a file to export the
    command. It will be stored as a *.startexplorer file, the format used internally
    is JSON. Commands that have been exported like that can be imported with the Import
    button on the preference page for custom commands. After importing a custom command
    it will be added to the end of the list. This feature makes it possible to share
    command definitions with other people.
    </p>

    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <p>
    StartExplorer supports is now integrated with the standard Eclipse mechanism and 
    thus support all variables that are defined in your Eclipse installation/workspace.
    This includes well known variables like <code>workspace_loc</code> <code>project_loc</code>,
    but generally every variable that is defined, either by Eclipse or by any installed
    plug-in or that has been added manually (for example via Preferences -&gt; Run/Debug
    -&gt; String Substitution) can be used in custom command definitions and the command
    definitions for and custom desktop environments. Variables that take arguments are
    also supported. The content assist functionality in the preference pages will show
    all available variables.  
    </p>
    <p>
    For example, in my workspace, the following variables are supported:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>${project_path}</code>: Returns the workspace relative path of a resource's project. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${project_name}</code>: Returns the name of a resource's project. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${project_loc}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of a resource's project. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${system_path}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of the external tool. Resolved by finding the first occurrence of the named tool based on the system path specification. The tool name must be supplied as an argument.</li>
      <li><code>${env_var}</code>: Returns the value of an environment variable. An environment variable name must be specified as an argument.</li>
      <li><code>${build_type}</code>: Returns the type of build being performed - "incremental", "full", "auto", or "none".</li>
      <li><code>${build_project}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of the project currently being built, or the absolute file system path of the resource identified by an optional argument interpreted as a path relative to the project currently being built.</li>
      <li><code>${container_name}</code>: Returns the name of a resource's container. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${build_files}</code>: Returns the set of absolute file system paths whose modification caused the current build.  A list of the characters, 'a' (added), 'c' (changed), 'r' (removed), 'f' (files only), 'd' (directories only), can be supplied as an argument to limit the file list to just those types of deltas.  Defaults to all deltas. </li>
      <li><code>${selected_text}</code>: Returns the text currently selected in the active editor.</li>
      <li><code>${java_type_name}</code>: Returns the fully qualified Java type name of the primary type in the selected resource.</li>

      <li><code>${selected_resource_path}</code>: Returns the workspace relative path of the selected resource.</li>
      <li><code>${container_path}</code>: Returns the workspace relative path of a resource's container. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${container_loc}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of a resource's container. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${eclipse_home}</code>: The location of the base installation for the running platform</li>
      <li><code>${resource_path}</code>: Returns the workspace relative path of a resource. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${file_prompt}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of a file chosen in a file selection dialog. When one argument is provided, it is used a prompt hint on the dialog title. When a second argument is provided, it is used as an initial value for the file selection dialog. The first and second arguments must be separated with a ':'.</li>
      <li><code>${resource_loc}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of a resource. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${java_extensions_regex}</code>: Regular expression matching registered Java-like file extensions </li>

      <li><code>${system}</code>: Returns the value of an Eclipse system variable. A variable name must be specified as an argument - one of ARCH, ECLIPSE_HOME, NL, OS, or WS.</li>
      <li><code>${workspace_loc}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of the workspace root. When an argument is specified, the absolute file system path of the resource identified by a workspace relative path is returned.</li>
      <li><code>${folder_prompt}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of a directory chosen in a directory selection dialog. When one argument is provided, it is used a prompt hint on the dialog title. When a second argument is provided, it is used as an initial value for the directory selection dialog. The first and second arguments must be separated with a ':'.</li>
      <li><code>${resource_name}</code>: Returns the name of a resource. The target resource is the selected resource when no argument is specified, or the resource identified by a workspace relative path.</li>
      <li><code>${string_prompt}</code>: Returns the text value entered into a prompt dialog. When one argument is provided, it is used as a prompt hint on the input dialog. When a second argument is provided, it is used as an initial value in the input dialog. The first and second arguments must be separated with a ':'.</li>
      <li><code>${selected_resource_loc}</code>: Returns the absolute file system path of the selected resource.</li>
      <li><code>${password_prompt}</code>: Returns the text value entered into a password prompt dialog. When one argument is provided, it is used as a prompt hint on the input dialog. When a second argument is provided, it is used as an initial value in the input dialog. The first and second arguments must be separated with a ':'.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In addition, StartExplorer itself offers a few variables of its own. For the examples,
    let the full path of the resource be C:\path\to\resource.txt  
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>${resource_path}</code>: Absolute path to selected resource
      (that is, <i>C:\path\to\resource.txt)</i>)</li>
      <li><code>${resource_name}</code>: File name or directory name of the resource,
      without path (that is, <i>resource.txt</i>)</li>
      <li><code>${resource_parent}</code>: Absolute path to parent of selected
      resource (that is, <i>C:\path\to</i>)</li>
      <li><code>${resource_name_without_extension}</code>: File name or directory
      name of the resource, without path and without extension (that is, 
      <i>resource</i>, without trailing dot)</li>
      <li><code>${resource_extension}</code>: Only the file's extension
		(that is, <i>txt</i>, without leading dot)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    The text field for the command also provides content assist. If you press CTRL + 
    Space or if you type '$' (and wait a second) the available variables will be
    listed, together with a short explanation.
    </p> 
    
    <h2>Custom Commmands Compared to External Tools</h2>
    <p>
    Custom Commands are similar to External Tools, which
    are available in Eclipse without the StartExplorer plug-in.
    Here are the main differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>External Tools offer a lot more variables to use for your command
      (StartExplorer may offer more variables in future versions, who knows?)
      </li> 
      <li>External Tools have significant longer startup times. Custom
      Commands are executed much faster. This is because External Tools
      are launched in a JVM of their own by default. Thus you have the
      JVM startup time plus the time the command needs to execute. StartExplorer
      Custom Commands are always launched in the same JVM as Eclipse, thus
      they start faster</li>
      <li>External Tools ignore selections of multiple resources. The external
      tool is only launched with the first selected resource. StartExplorer
      launches its commands on all selected resources.</li>      
    </ul>
