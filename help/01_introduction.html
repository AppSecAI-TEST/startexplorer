    <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Every now and then when working with Eclipse you'd like to examine a file or a 
        folder inside the Eclipse workspace with your Windows Explorer. Or you edit
        a configuration file in an Eclipse editor which references another file
        in the filesystem and you wonder what's in that file or you would like to
        open it in a different application. This plug-in gives you a convenient way to 
        do all this by adding a few entries to Eclipse's context menus. Furthermore,
        it offers a different (faster) way to issue any shell/dos command you like
        through customizable menu commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        This plug-in offers integration of the Windows Explorer, the 
        Windows command line, Windows default system applications and
        the clipboard into Eclipse. Some aspects may also be used on
        other operating systems but most of the features only work in
        a Windows environment (though support for other platforms
        could be added in later versions).
        The plug-in adds a new submenu named StartExplorer to Eclipse's
        standard context menus in two places. The first one is the context menu for
        resource views like the Navigator, the Java Package Explorer and so on.
        The second one is added to the context menu in editor views.
