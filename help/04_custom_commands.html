    <h1>Configuring Custom Commands</h1>
    <p>
    StartExplorer can be extended and customized by the user
    by custom commands. Custom commands are sent to the command
    line so your custom commands can do anything that you can
    do from the command line.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can add as many custom commands as you want. Custom 
    commands will be shown in a sub menu of StartExplorer's
    context menus.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Configuring Custom Commands</h2>
    <p>
    Go to Window - Preferences - StartExplorer to access
    StartExplorer's preference page. The upper area
    of the preference page is used to configure custom
    commands. The table shows you all configured custom
    commands. By default, there are already two custom commands
    (Notepad and UltraEdit). The buttons to the right
    of the table allow you to 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Add</b> new custom commands,</li>
      <li><b>Edit</b> existing custom commands,</li>
      <li><b>Remove</b> existing custom commands and</li>
      <li>reorder the custom commands by moving individual
      commands <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <a name="add"/>
    <h3>Add a new custom command</h3>
    <p>
    Click the <i>Add</i> button. You can configure the new custom command
    in the following dialog.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Command:</i> Enter the command to run. The command will
        be run via <code>java.lang.Runtime.exec</code>, that is,
        it will be executed as if you had entered the command on the
        command line.<br/>
        Example command: <code>notepad ${resource_path}</code><br/>
        This opens the selected file(s) in Notepad (notepad.exe needs
        to be on the system path). 
        <code>${resource_path}</code> is a <a href="#variables">variable</a>
        that will be replaced with the selected resouce's absolute path when
        the command is executed.
      </li>
      <li><i>Enabled for resources:</i> If this option is checked, the
      custom command will appear in the context menu for resource views
      (Navigator, Package Explorer, etc.). If the option is unchecked,
      the custom command will not be shown in this context menu (useful
      if you only want to use this custom command for selected text regions
      in editors).
      </li>
      <li><i>Name for resources menu:</i> The name which is shown in the
      context menu for resource views.
      </li>
      <li><i>Enabled for text selections:</i> If this option is checked,
      the custom command will appear in the context menu for selected text
      regions in editors. If the option is unchecked, the custom command
      will not be shown in this context menu (useful if you only want 
      to use this custom command in resource views).
      </li>
      <li><i>Name for text selection menu:</i>The name which shown in the
      context menu for selected text regions in editors.
      </li>
      <li><i>Pass selected text to application:</i> This changes the
      behaviour for the custom command when it is executed from within
      an editor for a selected text region. By default - when this option
      is <i>not</i> checked - the selected text will be interpreted
      as a filesystem path (denoting a file or a folder) and the custom
      command will be executed for this resource. If this option is checked
      the selected text will be passed to the command. StartExplorer
      will create a temp file which contains the selected text and
      calls the custom command with that temp file. To be precise:
      The variables <code>${resource_path}</code>, <code>${resource_name}</code>
      and <code>${resource_parent}</code> will be substituted with the
      temp file's path, name or parent path respectively. You almost
      will want to use the <code>${resource_path}</code> variable for
      this use case.
      <br/>
      Example: To pass the selected text to your favourite editor, say
      Notepad (although I doubt that this is your favourite editor),
      you could configure the command like this:
      </li>
      <ul>
	    <li><i>Command:</i> notepad ${resource_path}</li>
	    <li><i>Enabled for resources:</i> No</li>
	    <li><i>Name for resources menu:</i> leave this text field blank</li>
	    <li><i>Enabled for text selections:</i> Yes</li>
	    <li><i>Name for text selection menu:</i> Copy to Notepad</li>
	    <li><i>Pass selected text to application:</i> Yes</li>
	  </ul>
    </ul>    

    <h3>Edit an existing custom command</h3>
    <p>
    Select an existing custom command in the table and click the
    <i>Edit</i> button. You can configure the new custom command
    in the following dialog. The dialog is exactly the same
    as for <a href="#add">adding new custom commands</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>Remove an existing custom command</h3>
    <p>
    Select an existing custom command in the table and click the
    <i>Remove</i> button to delete custom commands.
    </p>

    <h3>Reorder the custom commands</h3>
    <p>
    Select an existing custom command in the table and use the
    buttons <i>Up</i> and <i>Down</i> to change the order in 
    which the custom commands appear in the context menu.
    </p>

    <a name="variables"/>
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    The following variables are available for your custom commands. For the examples,
    let the full path of the resource be C:\path\to\resource.txt  
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><code>${resource_path}</code>: Absolute path to selected resource
      (that is, <i>C:\path\to\resource.txt)</i>)</li>
      <li><code>${resource_name}</code>: File name or directory name of the resource,
      without path (that is, <i>resource.txt</i>)</li>
      <li><code>${resource_parent}</code>: Absolute path to parent of selected
      resource (that is, <i>C:\path\to</i>)</li>
      <li><code>${resource_name_without_extension}</code>: File name or directory
      name of the resource, without path and without extension (that is, 
      <i>resource</i>, without trailing dot)</li>
      <li><code>${resource_extension}</code>: Only the file's extension
		(that is, <i>txt</i>, without leading dot)</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Custom Commmands Compared to External Tools</h2>
    <p>
    Custom Commands are similar to External Tools, which
    are available in Eclipse without the StartExplorer plug-in.
    Here are the main differences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>External Tools offer a lot more variables to use for your command
      (StartExplorer may offer more variables in future versions, who knows?)
      </li> 
      <li>External Tools have significant longer startup times. Custom
      Commands are executed much faster. This is because External Tools
      are launched in a JVM of their own by default. Thus you have the
      JVM startup time plus the time the command needs to execute. StartExplorer
      Custom Commands are always launched in the same JVM as Eclipse, thus
      they start faster</li>
      <li>External Tools ignore selections of multiple resources. The external
      tool is only launched with the first selected resource. StartExplorer
      launches it's commands on all selected resources.</li>      
    </ul>
