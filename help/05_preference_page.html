    <h1>The StartExplorer Preference Page</h1>
    
    <p>
      The larger part of the preference page is used to configure 
      <a href="04_custom_commands.html">Custom Commands</a>.
      Besides that, you can configure the separator for the
      &quot;Copy resource path to clipboard&quot; command.
      When this command is executed while multiple resources are 
      selected, the paths of all selected resources are copied
      to the clipboard, separated by the separator configured here.
      The default separator is the unix line break.
      You can choose from unix line break, windows line break,
      mac line break and tab or you can enter any string you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, with the option &quot;Select File In Explorer&quot; you
      can configure the behaviour for the actions 
      &quot;Show resource(s) in Windows Explorer&quot;
      and &quot;Start a Windows Explorer in this path&quot;.
      If this option is checked and you select a file (not a directory),
      the corresponding file will be <i>selected</i> in the Windows
      Explorer instance that is to be opened. If the option is not checked,
      then just the content of the directory where the file resides
      is shown, without anything being selected.
