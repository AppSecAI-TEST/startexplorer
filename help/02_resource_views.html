      <h1>Files and Folders: Context Menu Options for Resources</h1>
      <p>
      In resource views like the Navigator or Package Explorer you can select files
      and folders. StartExplorer offers the following options here:
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Show in file manager</li>
          <li>Start shell here</li>
          <li>Open files with default application</li>
          <li>Copy resource path to clipboard</li>
          <li>Custom Commands</li>
        </ol>
      <p>
      All options work with a single selected resource as well as with multiple
      resources. If multiple resources are selected and an option only works for 
      files (or only for folders) all resources of the wrong type are ignored
      and the command is executed for the resources it is applicable for.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Show in file manager:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Starts a file manager (depending on your system, this might be the Windows
      Explorer, Finder on Mac OS, Nautilus on Gnome, Konqueror on KDE, Thunar on Xfce
      or PCMan File Manager on LXDE) for the selected resource. If it is a folder, the
      file manager is opened for this folder. If it is a file, the file manager 
      is opened for the parent folder of this file. On some systems (currently on 
      Windows and Mac OS) the file is also selected/highlighted in the file manager.
      If multiple resources are selected, a separate file manager instance is
      opened for each resource.      
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Start shell here:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Opens a shell/terminal/command line prompt with the selected folder
      as its starting directory. If multiple resources are selected, separate
      shells are opened for each of them. If a file is selected, a 
      shell for its parent directory will be opened. 
      </p>      
      <p>
      <b>Open files with default application:</b> (Works for files only)
      Opens the selected file in the application that is registered for
      this file type in your system. If multiple resources are selected then for each 
      resource the default application will be started separately.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Copy resource path to clipboard:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Copies the absolute path of the selected resource to the clipboard.
      If multiple resources are selected, all resource paths are copied
      to the clipboard, separated by a Unix linebreak. The separator
      can be configured in the <a href="04_preferences.html">preference page</a>
      for this plug-in.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b><a href="05_custom_commands.html">Custom Commands</a>:</b> You can
      configure any command you like here. Custom commands are 
      <a href="05_custom_commands.html">configured</a>
      in the preference page for this plug-in.
