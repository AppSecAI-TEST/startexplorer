      <h1>Editors: Context Menu Options for Selected Text Regions and Resources Opened In Editors</h1>
      <p>
      In editors (Java editor, text editor, ...) you also can execute StartExplorer actions,
      either on an empty text selection (that is, just right click anywhere in the editor
      window without selecting text first) or for a select text region. 
      StartExplorer offers the following options here:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Start a Windows Explorer in this path</li>
          <li>Start this file with system editor</li>
          <li>Start cmd.exe in this path</li>
          <li>Copy resource path to clipboard</li>
          <li><a href="04_custom_commands.html">Custom Commands</a></li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        These are the same options as for resource views like Navigator or Package Explorer 
        (except for custom commands, which might be configured differently for resource views
        and editors).
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference to the commands for resource is that these commands work based
        on the selected text region in an edior views. If no text is selected, the operation
        is executed on the file currently opened in the editor. This basically works the same
        way as if the file in the editor would have been selected in a resource view like
        Package Explorer.
      </p>
      <p> 
        If some text is selected the plug-in behaves quite differently and it is important to
        understand how StartExplorer works with selected text regions, otherwise you might get
        unexpected results.
      </p>
      <p>
      	When text is selected, the plug-in interprets 
        the selected text region as a filesystem path, denoting either a folder
        or a file. If this path denotes a folder, the plug-in can open a Windows Explorer 
        for it or start a command line prompt for this folder. If the aforementioned path 
        refers to a file rather than a directory, the plug-in can start the default 
        Windows system application for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, StartExplorer is a bit smarter when handling selected text regions 
        than the last paragraph may give the impression. If you try to open a Windows 
        Explorer for your selection it doesn't matter whether you selected a path denoting
        a folder or a file. If the selected text region points to a file, the parent directory
        of that file is shown in the Windows Explorer and the file is selected, just as you
        would expect. Furthermore, if the path ends with an incomplete path segment, the last
        segment is discarded.
        Example: In your text file (or XML file or whatever) you have the path 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code>. Now you select just 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> and start a Windows Explorer for that path.
        The plug-in recognizes that <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> is not a valid path
        and tries the parent directory <code>C:\path\to\some</code>. If this is a valid,
        existing directory, a Windows Explorer pops up showing <code>C:\path\to\some</code>.
        If you select &quot;Start cmd.exe in this path&quot; for 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code> then the directory
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory</code> will be shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the option &quot;Copy resource path to clipboard&quot; does not make
        a lot of sense with a text selection because it more or less only copies the
        selected text to the clipboard (with the difference that it might be reduced to a
        valid file system path, see above). But it still makes sense with empty text
        selections because in that case it copies the path of the file that is currently
        opened in the editor to the clipboard.

        The <a href="04_custom_commands.html">custom commands</a> are 
        completely configurable through the preference page,
        just as for the resource-based commands.
