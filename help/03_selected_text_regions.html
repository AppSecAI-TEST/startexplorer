      <h1>Editors: Context Menu Options for Selected Text Regions</h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Start a Windows Explorer in this path</li>
          <li>Start this file with system editor</li>
          <li>Start cmd.exe in this path</li>
          <li><a href="04_custom_commands.html">Custom Commands</a></li>
        </ul>
        Basically these are the same options as for resources in Navigator/Package Explorer,
        except that the &quot;Copy resource path to clipboard&quot; option is missing here
        (another function to copy a selected text region to the clipboard wouldn't add that 
        much value...).
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference to the commands for resource is that these commands work based
        on the selected text region in an edior views. The plug-in interprets 
        the selected text region as a filesystem path, denoting either a folder
        or a file. If this path denotes a folder, the plug-in can open a Windows Explorer 
        for it or start a command line prompt for this folder. If the aforementioned path 
        refers to a file rather than a directory, the plug-in can start the default 
        Windows system application for it.

        Actually, StartExplorer is a bit smarter when handling selected text regions 
        than the last paragraph may give the impression. If you try to open a Windows 
        Explorer for your selection it doesn't matter whether you selected a path denoting
        a folder or a file. If the selected text region points to a file, the parent directory
        of that file is shown in the Windows Explorer, just as you would expect. Furthermore,
        if the path ends with an incomplete path segment, the last segment is discarded.
        Example: In your text file (or XML file or whatever) you have the path 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code>. Now you select just 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> and start a Windows Explorer for that path.
        The plug-in recognizes that <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> is not a valid path
        and tries the parent directory <code>C:\path\to\some</code>. If this is a valid,
        existing directory, a Windows Explorer pops up showing <code>C:\path\to\some</code>.
        If you select &quot;Start cmd.exe in this path&quot; for 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code> then the directory
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory</code> will be shown.

        The <a href="04_custom_commands.html">custom commands</a> are 
        completely configurable through the preference page,
        just as for the resource-based commands.
