      <h1>Files and Folders: Context Menu Options for Resources</h1>
      <p>
      In resource views like the Navigator or Package Explorer you can select files
      and folders. StartExplorer offers the following options here:
      </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Show resource(s) in Windows Explorer</li>
          <li>Start this (these) file(s) with system editor</li>
          <li>Start cmd.exe here</li>
          <li>Copy resource path to clipboard</li>
          <li>Custom Commands</li>
        </ol>
      <p>
      All options work with a single selected resource as well as with multiple
      resources. If multiple resources are selected and an option only works for 
      files (or only for folders) all resources of the wrong type are ignored
      and the command is executed for the resources it is applicable for.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Show resource(s) in Windows Explorer:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Starts a Windows Explorer for the selected resource. If it is a folder, a 
      Windows Explorer is opened for this folder. If it is a file, a Windows 
      Explorer is opened for the parent folder of this file and the file is selected.
      If multiple resources are selected, a separate Windows Explorer instance is
      opened for each resource.      
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Start this (these) file(s) with system editor:</b> (Works for files only)
      Opens the selected file in the Windows application that is associated
      with it's file type. If multiple resources are selected then for each 
      resource the default application will be started separately.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Start cmd.exe here:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Opens a command line prompt with the selected folder as it's starting
      directory. If multiple resources are selected, separate commmand line 
      prompts are opened for each of them. If a file is selected, a 
      command line prompt for it's parent directory will be opened. 
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Copy resource path to clipboard:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Copies the absolute path of the selected resource to the clipboard.
      If multiple resources are selected, all resource paths are copied
      to the clipboard, separated by a Unix linebreak. The separator
      can be configured in the <a href="05_preference_page.html">preference page</a>
      for this plug-in.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b><a href="04_custom_commands.html">Custom Commands</a>:</b> You can
      configure any command you like here. Custom commands are 
      <a href="04_custom_commands.html">configured</a>
      in the preference page for this plug-in.
