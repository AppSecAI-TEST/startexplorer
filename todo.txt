ID: 3000995: Linux support
Actually the plugin support only Windows platform.
I think that supporting also linux systems, may be throw preference page can be
useful for those, like me, that use eclipse on those systems.

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3477655&group_id=226435&atid=1067715:
Menu placement: The Eclipse menus are very heavy, there is a lot of items. That is why
menus group items into submenus. And, there is a special "Open With" or "Show In" group
for opening extensions like this. I think it had to be reused. "Copy resource path into
clipboard" does not fit this category indeed. But, it is not that necessary since
Eclipse is the Number One IDE in providing user access to resource path info.
Just click Properties item, right next to your StartExplorer.

== Other items ==

* Allow copy resource path to clipboard also for editors - makes sense with empty text selection
* Context Assist for variables in configuration dialog for custom commands
* Help button on preference page
* Have an option for custom commands to have them appear
  in 
  a) the custom commands sub menu
  b) the start explorer menu directly
  c) the top level context menu
* keyboard bindings for custom commands
* configurable icons for custom commands?
* differentiate between resource commands and text selection
  commands for keyboard shortcuts -> different contexts.
  How to do that? (See misc/context.ids)
