ID: ???????: From an editor window, do not only offer StartExplorer
functionality for the current text selection, but also for the
resource currently opened in the editor window.

ID: 2931227: Ctrl+Alt+E shortcut unchangeable
Shortcut for Show Resource(s) in Windows Explorer cannot be changed
in Eclipse -> Preferences -> Keys. This is crucial as due to some
other Eclipse bug Alt Gr + Key (which is used to type national language
characters) is interpreted as Ctrl+Alt+Key (like this StartExplorer binding). The
result is that I cannot type polish 'Ä™' character (Alt Gr + E). If this shortcut
would be changable I could walkaround this eclipse issue.

ID: 2925191: please add "start explorer" from file tab

Thanks.

ID: 3000995: Linux support
Actually the plugin support only Windows platform.
I think that supporting also linux systems, may be throw preference page can be
useful for those, like me, that use eclipse on those systems.
