* Test path with spaces on linux. If problematic, maybe find a different workaround than quoting it.

* Maybe an update site on GitHub would work after all. Could be it only didn't
  work in Eclipse Helios due to borked UIT proxy settings :-(

* Copy resource path to clipboard in editor never uses the selection, always the file opened in the editor

* Put something in the GitHub-wiki. Examples/ideas:
  - custom commands:
    - Open WinSCP for folder & direct upload of a file with WinSCP
    - Open jar file with WinZip/7Zip
    - execute groovy script on file/folder 
    - Start BeyondCompare on two folders / files

* Screenshots for README.markdown and project page

* Remove duplication
