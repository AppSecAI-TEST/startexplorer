== TODOs for Linux Support ==

* Test auto-detection on windows

* Create preference for OS/Desktop Manager choice
* Integrate OS/Desktop Manager choice into preference page
* Preference Migration: Since this plug-in only worked for Windows until now, we can safely
  assume that old preference stores should migrate to Windows
* Provide Preferences for custom scheme for standard commands, similar to custom commands
* New Preference Page Layout:
  StartExplorer Options
  - Standard Options
    - OS/Desktop Manager
      -> Dialog for custom scheme 
    - Separator for Copy resource path to clipboard
    - Select/highlight file in file manager (if supported, otherwise disabled)
  - Custom Commands
    -> Dialog for configuring a single custom command 
* Preference Page options:
  - Auto Detect (Default for new users)
  - Windows (Existing users will be migrated to this option)
  - Linux/Gnome
  - Linux/KDE
  - Mac(?)
  - Custom
* Test if Windows still works 
* Merge back to trunk

== Mac support ==
* Auto-Detection for Mac
* Command strings for Mac

== HIGH PRIO ==

* Bug: If content assist in preference page for custom command is triggered by
  auto activation character, the activation character is not deleted which leads
  to duplicate $ or { characters.
* Bug: Deselecting "Select file in Explorer" has no effect and is not stored in
  preferences.

* keyboard bindings for custom commands

ID: 3000995: Linux support
Actually the plugin support only Windows platform.
I think that supporting also linux systems, may be throw preference page can be
useful for those, like me, that use eclipse on those systems.
>>>>Install some vmWare thingy and install linux in it

== MEDIUM PRIO ==

* differentiate between resource commands and text selection
  commands for keyboard shortcuts -> different contexts.
  How to do that? (See misc/context.ids)
* configurable icons for custom commands?

== LOW PRIO ==

* https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3477655&group_id=226435&atid=1067715:
Menu placement: The Eclipse menus are very heavy, there is a lot of items. That is why
menus group items into submenus. And, there is a special "Open With" or "Show In" group
for opening extensions like this. I think it had to be reused. "Copy resource path into
clipboard" does not fit this category indeed. But, it is not that necessary since
Eclipse is the Number One IDE in providing user access to resource path info.
Just click Properties item, right next to your StartExplorer.

* Help button on preference page

* Have an option for custom commands to have them appear
  in 
  a) the custom commands sub menu
  b) the start explorer menu directly
  c) the top level context menu
