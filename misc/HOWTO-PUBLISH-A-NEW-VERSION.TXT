* Check that help is up to date (did you implement new features?)

* Go to de.bastiankrol.startexplorer/MANIFEST.INF

  as in the version attribute

  de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite/plugins and
  de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite/features

  commit and push
  
* If you want to check if the new version can be correctly installed through the
  Eclipse update mechanism, beware: if you contacted the update site before the
  upload, you might need to restart Eclipse to see the new data from the remote
  update site. Eclipse seems to cache this information.

  de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite/plugins
