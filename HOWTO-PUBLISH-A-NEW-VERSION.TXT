* Check that help is up to date (did you implement new features?)

* Go to de.bastiankrol.startexplorer/MANIFEST.INF 
* Set Bundle-Version to the new version number, like 1.x.y.qualifier (qualifier as literal)
* OR: In tab Overview, change field Version, that's the same
* Go to de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-feature/feature.xml, Tab Overview.
* Enter the same version number as above in the Version field, without the .qualifier.
* Go to de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite/site.xml, tab site.xml
* Correct the version number in the jar referenced in the url attribute as well
  as in the version attribute
* Go to de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite/site.xml, tab Site Map.
* Click "Build All"
* Check that new jars with the corresponding versions have been build in 
  de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite/plugins and
  de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite/features
* Copy following files from de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite 
  to the gh-pages branch
  - plugins/de.bastiankrol.startexplorer_1.x.y.2012xxxxxxxx.jar (to /update/plugins) 
  - features/de.bastiankrol.startexplorer.feature_1.x.y.jar (to the /update/features)
  - artifacts.xml (to /update)
  - content.xml (to /update)
  - site.xml (to /update)
* Add these files to git
* Commit and push plugin-project, feature-project and update-site-project
* Commit and push gh-pages branch
* (This process is quite redundant - the update-site project should be in branch
  gh-pages) 
  
* If you want to check if the new version can be correctly installed through the
  Eclipse update mechanism, beware: if you contacted the update site before the
  upload, you might need to restart Eclipse to see the new data from the remote
  update site. Eclipse seems to cache this information.

* Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/startexplorer/files/startexplorer/
* Log in
* Create a new folder for the version
* Upload (via web browser) the plug-in jar from 
  de.bastiankrol.startexplorer-updatesite/plugins to the sourceforge website
* Click the i-icon next to the newly uploaded file
* Under "Default Download For:", click the "Select All" link and save
  (it takes a minute or until this setting is honored by sourceforge)
* Update de.bastiankrol.startexplorer/misc/release-notes/README.txt and upload it
  to the same folder as the plug-in jar.

* If help was updated, copy it to project web site
