        Warning: Some parts of this plug-in only work
        with Windows.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Every now and then when working with Eclipse you'd like to examine a file or a 
        folder inside the Eclipse workspace with your Windows Explorer. Or you edit
        a configuration file in an Eclipse editor which references another file
        in the filesystem and you wonder what's in that file or you would like to
        open it in a different application. This plug-in gives you a convenient way to 
        do all this by adding a few entries to Eclipse's context menus. Furthermore,
        it offers a different (faster) way to issue any shell/dos command you like
        through customizable menu commands.
        <br><a href="#top">Top</a>

      <a name="description"></a>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This plug-in offers a convenient integration of the Windows Explorer, the 
        Windows command line, Windows default system applications and the clipboard
        into Eclipse. It adds a new submenu to Eclipse's standard context menus
        named StartExplorer in two places. The first one is the context menu for
        resource views like the Navigator, the Java Package Explorer and so on.
        The second on is added to the context menu for selected text regions in 
        editor views. 
      </p>
      <h3>Context Menu Options for Resources</h3>
      In resource views like the Navigator or Package Explorer you can select files
      and folders. StartExplorer offers the following options here:
       <ol>
         <li>Show resource(s) in Windows Explorer</li>
         <li>Start this (these) file(s) with system editor</li>
         <li>Start cmd.exe here</li>
         <li>Copy resource path to clipboard</li>
         <li>Custom Commands</li>
       </ol>
      <p>
      All options work with a single selected resource as well as with multiple
      resources. If multiple resources are selected and an option only works for 
      files (or only for folders) all resources of the wrong type are ignored
      and the command is executed for the resources it is applicable for.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Show resource(s) in Windows Explorer:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Starts a Windows Explorer for the selected resource. If it is a folder, a 
      Windows Explorer is opened for this folder. If it is a file, a Windows 
      Explorer is opened for the parent folder of this file. If multiple
      resources are selected, a separate Windows Explorer instance is opened
      for each resource.      
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Start this (these) file(s) with system editor:</b> (Works for files only)
      Opens the selected file in the Windows application that is associated
      with it's file type. If multiple resources are selected then for each 
      resource the default application will be started separately.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Start cmd.exe here:</b> (Works for folders only)
      Opens a command line prompt with the selected folder as it's starting
      directory. If multiple resources are selected, separate commmand line 
      prompts are opened for each of them.
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Copy resource path to clipboard:</b> (Works for files and folders)
      Copies the absolute path of the selected resource to the clipboard.
      If multiple resources are selected, all resource paths are copied
      to the clipboard, separated by a comma (&quot;,&quot;).
      </p>
      <p>
      <b>Custom Commands:</b> You can configure any command you like here.
      Use the preference page for this plug-in.      
      </p>

      <h3>Context Menu Options for selected text regions</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>Start a Windows Explorer in this path</li>
         <li>Start this file with system editor</li>
         <li>Start cmd.exe in this path</li>
         <li>Custom Commands</li>
       </ul>
      <p>
        Basically these are the same options as for resources in Navigator/Package Explorer,
        except that the &quot;Copy resource path to clipboard&quot; option is missing here
        (another function to copy a selected text region to the clipboard wouldn't add that 
        much value...).
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference to the commands for resource is that these commands work based
        on the selected text region in an edior views. The plug-in interprets 
        the selected text region as a filesystem path, denoting either a folder
        or a file. If this path denotes a folder, the plug-in can open a Windows Explorer 
        for it or start a command line prompt for this folder. If the aforementioned path 
        refers to a file rather than a directory, the plug-in can start the default 
        Windows system application for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, StartExplorer is a bit smarter when handling selected text regions 
        than the last paragraph may give the impression. If you try to open a Windows 
        Explorer for your selection it doesn't matter whether you selected a path denoting
        a folder or a file. If the selected text region points to a file, the parent directory
        of that file is shown in the Windows Explorer, just as you would expect. Furthermore,
        if the path ends with an incomplete path segment, the last segment is discarded.
        Example: In your text file (or XML file or whatever) you have the path 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code>. Now you select just 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> and start a Windows Explorer for that path.
        The plug-in recognizes that <code>C:\path\to\some\dire</code> is not a valid path
        and tries the parent directory <code>C:\path\to\some</code>. If this is a valid,
        existing directory, a Windows Explorer pops up showing <code>C:\path\to\some</code>.
        If you select &quot;Start cmd.exe in this path&quot; for 
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory\file.xyz</code> then the directory
        <code>C:\path\to\some\directory</code> will be shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        The custom commands are completely configurable through the preference page,
        just as for the resource-based commands.

      <h2>Information for Developers</h2>
      Well, I guess there's not much to develop here since this plug-in is really
      small and dead simple. Actually, authoring this website took much longer
      than coding the plug-in. Anyway, if you would like to mess around with the
      source code or modify it or extend it or whatever, go ahead. The
      code is available from the Subversion repository at sourceforge.net, the
      relevant repository URLs being:
      <table border="1">
