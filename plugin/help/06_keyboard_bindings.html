    <h1>Keyboard Bindings</h1>

<p>
StartExplorer offers basic keyboard binding support.
The predefined commands have shortcuts:
</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Keyboard Binding</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Start Explorer</td>
    <td>Strg+Alt+E</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Start cmd.exe</td>
    <td>Strg+Alt+D</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Start System Application</td>
    <td>Strg+Alt+A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Copy Resource Path to Clipboard
    <td>Strg+Alt+C</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The keyboard bindings
are configurable by standard eclipse means
(Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Keys). The category's name is
&quot;StartExplorer&quot;.  
</p>

<p>
There is one caveat: The resource based versions of each
command and the text selection based versions of the same
command share the same binding. Both use the binding of
the resource based version. Example: "Show resource(s)
in Windows Explorer" (for a resource from the
Navigator/Package Explorer) uses Strg+Alt+E as well as
"Start a Windows Explorer in this path" (for a text
selection in an editor view) does. Only
"Show resource(s) in Windows Explorer" may be bound to
a new key binding, which is then applied to both commands.

There are no keyboard bindings for custom commands yet.
